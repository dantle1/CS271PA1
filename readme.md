## Project 1: Blockchain Demo based on Lamport Logic Clocks

### Description

Refer to the project [description](./result/Winter23_CS271_Project1.pdf) for details.

### Brief thoughts of solutions

**Data structures**

- `Transaction`: basic transaction information, as well as for data verification for HTTP GET/POST communication.
- `Block`: a primitive encapsulation of a transaction, with additional properties `next_block` and `previous_hash` and the method `hash()` to calculate the hash value of itself.
- `BlockChain`: a chain of blocks. When it add a new transaction via `add_transaction`, it will firstly append a corresponding block to it and resort all blocks according to their Lamport logic clock values `(sender_logic_clock, sender_id)`, and then recompute all hash values.
- `Server`: Singleton, defined in `server.py`.
- `Client`: Singleton, defined in `client.py`. Each registered `client` among the system holds an identical `blockchain`, a sending message queue `sending_quque` and a receiving message queue `message_queue`.


**Distributed communication and processing approaches**
In our implementation, each communication is an HTTP request-response process realized by Python `requests`/`grequests` libraries and `FastAPI` framework.

- "Balance" is not mutual exclusive, so it is instantly responded by the `server`. When a `client` sponsors a "balance", it communicates only with the `server`, and its `logic_block` increases (local event).
- "Transfer" is mutual exclusive cause the `server` can only process one transfer transaction at one time. Herein the "Lamport distributed exclusion protocol" is used for the mutual exclusive purpose.
  - When one `client` sponsors a "transfer", it firstly increase its `logic_clock` (send event) and broadcasts this request to all other `client`s, and anticipates to received their replies. The `client` also put this transfer transaction into its `sending_queue` and `message_queue`.
  - When one `client` receives this kind of request, its `logic_clock` increases (receive event) and sends a reply to the sender, as well as puts this transfer transaction into its `message_queue`.
  - There is a `TimeLoop` scheduler for each `client` that is in charge of checking whether there is any sponsored transaction on the head of `sending_queue` and begin to process it once conditions are satisfied: (1) the transfer transaction is on the head of `sending_queue`; (2) it received replies from all other `clients`s for this transaction; (3) it is also on the head of `message_queue`.
  - To process a transaction, the `client` first sends a "balance" request to the `server`.
    - If `balance < amount`, the transfer transaction is ABORT. The `client` broadcasts a transaction release (finished) signals to all other clients.
    - If `balance >= amount`, the `client` continue to send a "transfer" request to the `server` to update balances of the `client` and its receiver. Then transaction is SUCCESS. 
    - Whether ABORT or SUCCESS, the `client` broadcasts a transaction release (finished) signals to all other clients, and then add the transaction to its `blockchain`.
  - When one`client` receives a transaction release signal, it add it to its `blockchain` and removes the transaction from its `message_queue` (not necessarily the head of `message_queue`).


### Usage:

Change current directory to `./src/`, then:

1. start the bank server by using `python server.py`

2. start some clients: You can subsequently use `python client.py` in different terminals.

3. Then you can interact with all these server and client terminal interfaces.

The figure below shows the demonstration of the program.

### Comments:

The conventional "Lamport distributed protocol" it too ideal as the figure below depicts. It cannot work well if no additional strategies.

![lamport](./result//lamport.png)


Take the case of three clients and they operate almost simultaneously as follows:
1. Client 3: `t 1 12` (Client 1 transfers $12 to Client 1)
2. Client 2: `t 3 5` (Client 2 transfers $5 to Client 3)
3. Client 3: `t 1 11` (Client 3 transfers $11 to Client 1)

In realistic-scenario testing, there always appears the phenomenon:
- Client 1: `message_queue = [Transaction(2, 3, 5), Transaction(3, 1, 12)]`, `sending_queue = []`
- Client 2: `message_queue = [Transaction(2, 3, 5), Transaction(3, 1, 12)]`, `sending_queue = [Transaction(2, 3, 5)]`
- Client 3: `message_queue = [Transaction(3, 1, 12)]`, `sending_queue = [Transaction(3, 1, 12)]`

during communication. At this time point, actually Client 3 regards that its first transaction is satisfied to be processed, although. Since for any distributed system, it is non-sharing and non-status, the procedure of processing `Transaction(3, 1, 12)` cannot be held back. So both `sending_queue` and `message_queue` are necessary and convenient for message processing. To ensure the consistency of all `client`s' `blockchain`s, once a transaction is added to the chain, the chain is resorted and all hash values are recomputed. Thus the results could be as follows:

*Print balance records of the `server`:*

```
client_id	balance	
        1	21.0	
        2	5.0	
        3	4.0	
```

*Print the blockchain of any one `client`:*

```

Total blocks: 3

Block 0:
  transaction: sender_id=2 recipient_id=3 amount=5.0 sender_logic_clock=1 timestamp='2023-02-09T15:53:07' status='SUCCESS' num_replies=2

  next_block: Block(transaction=(3, 1, 12.0), timestamp=2023-02-09T15:53:06)

Block 1:

```


In the above case, the processing sequence is `Transaction(2, 1, 12) -> ABORT, Transaction(2, 3, 5) -> SUCCESS, Transaction(3, 1, 12) -> SUCCESS`. While the final blockchain's sequence is `Transaction(sender_logic_clock=1, 2, 3, 5, SUCCESS), Transaction(sender_logic_clock=1, 3, 1, 12, ABORT), Transaction(..., 2, 1, 11, SUCCESS)`.
